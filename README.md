# JavaScript Calculator

This challenge was proposed by freeCodeCamp. My solution is also available in my codePen profile, can be access through this [link](https://codepen.io/carolinabranquinho/pen/KKzVxLB).

## Technologies used

In this challenge, I had to make a simple calculator with the four basic operations. This project was made to test the knowledge in front end libraries and frameworks.

I choose made this app in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.

- **JQuery**

JQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree, event handling, CSS animation and AJAX. I used some event handling like .text() to write the numbers and operations in the display of the calculator and the function .on() as the click eventListener.
